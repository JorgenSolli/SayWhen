# [SayWhen](https://say-when.herokuapp.com/)

Never miss a product release again!

## What's this?

SayWhen was made because signing up for newsletters that promise to let you know when a product is in stock, is unreliable.
This is especially true when the product in question is in high demand.

## Why is SayWhen more reliable?

Retailers cannot send out thousands of emails at the same time. They would be marked as spam blazingly fast by email-clients.

This is where SayWhen comes in to play. SayWhen sends out emails the second a product you watch is in stock.

Hopefully, this tool can help you snatch the product you're so patiently waiting for.
